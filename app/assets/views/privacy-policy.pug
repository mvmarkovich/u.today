                    h3 10.1 What is “cookie”

                    p Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a server during a browsing session. Cookies are typically stored on your computer’s hard drive and are used by web sites to simulate a continuous connection to that site. The use of cookies automatically identifies your browser whenever you interact with a site. When we talk about “cookies” in this Privacy Policy, we mean not just cookies, but all similar technologies.

                    p Cookies and similar technologies allow us to collect the following types of personal data: a unique ID assigned to your device; IP address; device and browser type; operating system; referring URLs; content viewed or other actions taken through our Website; time and date of those actions; country and language selected.

                    p Browsers and devices have tools that allow you to disable cookies on sites and apps. If you disable cookies you may not be able to access all the features of our Website.

                    p <strong>Session cookies</strong> remember you during your session on our Website. They are deleted when you log out of the Website and when you close your web browser. Session cookies are used to ensure you are served content correctly, to balance and monitor load on our servers, and for other technical matters essential to the operation of our Website.

On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Sites, to compile reports on Site activity and to provide us with other Website relating to website and internet use.

                    p If you are an EU or UK resident, you have certain rights in respect of the information that we hold about you. Below is a short overview of those rights: <br><strong>Access.</strong> With some exceptions designed to protect the rights of others, you have the right to a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. Where the data is data that you have given to us, you have the right to receive your copy of it in a common electronic format, and to provide copies of it to other people if you wish. <br><strong>Correction.</strong> You have the right to have the personal data we hold about you corrected if it is factually inaccurate. This right does not extend to matters of opinion, such as views expressed in editorial content. <br><strong>Deletion.</strong> In some limited circumstances, you have the right to have personal data that we hold about you erased (the “right to be forgotten”). This right is not generally available where we still have a valid legal reason to keep the data (for example, because we are obliged to do so by law). <br><strong>Objection.</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data where we rely on “legitimate interests” as our legal basis for processing, but we may be able to continue processing if our interest outweighs your objection.<br><strong>Withdrawing consent.</strong> If we are processing your personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, in which case we will stop that processing unless we have another legal basis on which to continue.

                    h3 11.3 How to exercise your rights

                    p To exercise your rights, email <a href="mailto:consent@u.today">consent@u.today</a>

                    p In order to protect your privacy and that of others, we will ask you to prove your identity before we take any steps in response to a request you have made. If a third party is making a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove that they have your permission to act for you.

                    p We may contact you to ask you for further information to help you exercise your legal rights or to speed up our response. We will try to respond to requests within one month and we will let you know if we need to take longer, for example because your request is complicated. We may have an overriding lawful basis for processing your personal data, or certain exemptions may apply. If we refuse your request, we will explain why.

                    h3 11.4 Complaints

                    p You have the right to complain about data privacy matters to the Information Commissioner’s Office (<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>), or the relevant data protection regulator in your country of residence.

                    p Categories of Information We Collect:

                    ul
                        li Online identifiers (e.g. IP address, ADID/IDFA, cookie IDs, internal identification numbers).

                    p Purpose of Collection

                    p We may share your personal data with government entities when required to do by law. If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal data we collect, disclose, and “sell” about you (as that term is used in the CCPA).

                    p Additionally, you have the right to access, delete and opt out from the “sale” of your personal data.

                    p Specifically, California residents may request that we: Inform you about the categories of personal data we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such data; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal data; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal data. Such information is also set forth above in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that certain data may be exempt from such access, data portability, and deletion requests under California law. For example, we need to retain certain data in order to provide the Website to you. Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal data. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or deletion twice within a 12-month period.

You can find instructions on how to proceed at our <a href="https://u.today/consent-settings">consent settings center</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:consent@u.today">consent@u.today</a>

                    p Please note that the verifiable consumer request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal data or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal data relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an Account with us. We will only use personal data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
